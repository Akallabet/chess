  1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {This variation was tested
  in two games by GM Richard Rapport in the last Candidates Tournament. I have
  played this position with Black more or less fifty times during my career.
  Fischer, however, played it only this time.} 6. Be3 (6. Nxc6 {This is the main
  move and it's always been what bothered me the most.}) 6... Nf6 7. Bd3 (7. Qd2
  {This is one of the most dangerous moves when followed by f3 and g4. But what is
  now known as the English Attack was not yet popular in the 1970s. It began to be
  explored more during the 1980s, thanks to several English chess players who
  began implementing this setup against various Sicilian forms.}) 7... d5 $6
  {Interestingly, before the match this move had only been played in two games by
  Adolph Anderssen in the 19th century. We have an unexplored position on the
  board that Spassky did not expect. This central break leads to a somewhat worse
  position for Black with an isolated queen's pawn.} (7... Qc7 {is the main
  move.}) 8. exd5 exd5 {The best way to recapture. If Black takes with the knight,
  White gets the advantage in many ways.} (8... Nxd5 $6 9. Nxd5 (9. Nxc6 bxc6 10.
  Nxd5 $1 cxd5 11. Bd4 {And the white bishops aim dangerously towards the
  kingside.}) 9... Qxd5 10. Nxc6 Qxc6 11. Qg4 $1 {with a clear advantage for
  White.}) 9. O-O $6 (9. Qd2 $1 {With the idea of castling on the queenside and then
  starting an advance with f3-g4, is a more promising plan for White.}) 9... Bd6
  {Now Black has no big problems.The legendary GM Ulf Andersson, a specialist in
  Sicilian, lost three games with the black pieces in this position, but in all of
  them he managed to achieve a good position in the opening.} 10. Nxc6 (10. Bf5
  O-O 11. Bxc8 Rxc8 12. Nxc6 bxc6 {with a comfortable position in
  Ivanovic-Andersson, Bugojno 1984.}) (10. Be2 h6 11. Re1 O-O 12. Bf3 Re8 {with
  equal chances in Timman-Andersson, London 1984.}) (10. h3 O-O 11. Re1 Re8 12.
  Nxc6 bxc6 {with a good position for Black in Topalov-Andersson, Monte Carlo
  1997.}) 10... bxc6 11. Bd4 O-O 12. Qf3 $6 (12. Na4 $5 {controlling the c5 square
  and preparing the c2-c4 advance was a more interesting option. Anyway, Black has
  a good position.} 12... Rb8 13. b3 Qe7 {with equality.}) 12... Be6 $6 (12... Ng4 $1
  {This move would create serious problems for White. The idea is:} 13. h3 Qg5 $3
  {A brilliant move $1 The knight cannot be captured and White must play accurately
  so as not to lose immediately.} (13... Nh2 $2 14. Qh5 g6 15. Qh6) 14. g3 $1 (14.
  hxg4 $2 Bxg4 15. Qe3 Bf4 $1 16. Bxh7+ {The only way to free up space for the queen.}
  16... Kxh7 17. Qd3+ Kg8 {And Black has a decisive attack with the bishops aiming
  for White's king.}) 14... Ne5 15. Bxe5 Bxe5 {with a comfortable advantage thanks
  to the pair of bishops.}) 13. Rfe1 {Capturing at f6 immediately was also
  possible. After} (13. Bxf6 Qxf6 14. Qxf6 gxf6 15. Ne2 c5 16. Rad1 Be5 {Black has
  a slight pressure, but a draw is the most likely outcome.}) 13... c5 14. Bxf6
  Qxf6 15. Qxf6 gxf6 16. Rad1 Rfd8 (16... Be5 {is a serious alternative.} 17.
  Be2 $5 Rab8 (17... Bxc3 18. bxc3 $12) 18. Nxd5 Rxb2 19. Bxa6 {and White should be
  able to hold the position.}) 17. Be2 $1 {Spassky plays the next moves accurately.
  He needs to be fast, otherwise the bishop's pair can be dangerous, especially in
  the hands of Fischer, who was an expert at handling the advantage of a bishop
  against a knight.} 17... Rab8 18. b3 c4 {A critical moment.} 19. Nxd5 $1 {It's
  necessary to sacrifice the exchange to achieve an equal game.} (19. bxc4 $2 Bb4
  {and Black wins material.}) (19. Na4 $6 Bf5 {and the bishops are too strong.})
  19... Bxd5 20. Rxd5 Bxh2+ 21. Kxh2 Rxd5 22. Bxc4 {White is very active and has
  no problems holding this endgame.} 22... Rd2 23. Bxa6 (23. Bd3 $5 {this is a very
  interesting tactical idea which guarantees a draw in a rook endgame.} 23... Rxf2
  24. Rd1 $1 {Now the f2-rook has no squares.} (24. Kg3 {is also enough for a
  draw.}) 24... Rc8 $1 (24... Rf4 $2 25. Bxa6 {And with three passed pawns, White has
  the advantage.}) 25. Kg3 Rfxc2 26. Bxc2 Rxc2 {and this ending is drawn in
  different ways. For example:} 27. Rd6 (27. a4 Rc3+ 28. Kf2 Rxb3 29. Rd6 Kg7 30.
  Rxa6 {with an easy draw, since Black's structure is broken.}) 27... Rxa2 28.
  Rxf6 Kg7 29. Rb6 {followed by b4-b5 and the exchange of pawns on the queenside,
  leading to an easy theoretical draw.}) 23... Rxc2 24. Re2 Rxe2 25. Bxe2 {This
  ending is easily drawn, as the queenside pawns are a constant danger from
  Black's rook. In addition, the broken structure on the kingside hinders any
  serious victory attempt. It's surprising that Spassky loses this position.}
  25... Rd8 26. a4 Rd2 27. Bc4 Ra2 {The rook must get behind the pawns, preventing
  them from advancing.} 28. Kg3 Kf8 29. Kf3 Ke7 30. g4 $6 {An unnecessary move,
  despite not being the decisive mistake. It's simpler to leave the pawn on g3.}
  (30. g3 f5 31. Bd3 Kf6 32. Bc4 {and Black has no winning plan.}) 30... f5 $1 {Now
  Fischer creates a passed pawn.} 31. gxf5 f6 32. Bg8 h6 33. Kg3 Kd6 34. Kf3 $4
  {This is a blunder. White loses by one detail: the bad positioning of the
  g8-bishop.} (34. f4 {Prevents the king from reaching e5 and draws easily, for
  example:} 34... Ra1 35. Bc4 Kc5 36. Kg4 {preparing Kh5 and if Black stops this
  with} 36... Rh1 {then} 37. a5 $1) 34... Ra1 $1 {A precise move, which for a tactical
  reason brings Black's king to f4.} (34... Ke5 $2 {is not enough:} 35. Be6 Ra1 36.
  Kg4 $1 {with a draw.}) 35. Kg2 {Necessary, otherwise the king gets cut after Rg1
  and the h-pawn decides the game.} (35. Bc4 Rg1 $1 36. a5 h5 37. a6 Kc7 {followed
  by the advance of the h-pawn.}) (35. Kg3 $2 Rg1+ {wins the bishop.}) 35... Ke5 36.
  Be6 Kf4 {With the king on f4, Black has a clear winning plan: advance the h-pawn
  and support it with the king.} 37. Bd7 Rb1 38. Be6 Rb2 39. Bc4 (39. a5 Ra2 40.
  b4 Ra4 {wins one of the passed pawns.}) 39... Ra2 40. Be6 h5 41. Bd7 {The game
  was adjourned, but there was no point in continuing. The winning plan is very
  simple.} (41. Bd7 Kg4 42. Be6 h4 43. Bd7 h3+ 44. Kg1 Ra1+ 45. Kh2 Rf1 {and the
  f2-pawn is lost.}) 0-1`,
